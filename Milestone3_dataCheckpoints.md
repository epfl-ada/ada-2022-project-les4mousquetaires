In this milestone, some datas were processed independently between the musketeers. Thus, pickles have been stored in a separated google drive so that they are accessible to all.

The link of the drive can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dgT9nXjohbbKP9wWSo9Y9FYZcKwdT8FV?usp=sharing

As most of the analysis had already been done in milestone 2, the codes in milestone 3 essentially contain the use of the results of milestone 2 to make figures.
